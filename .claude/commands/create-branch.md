# Create Branch

Follow these steps to create a new branch based on uncommitted and staged changes:

1. Check current git status using `git status` to see uncommitted and staged changes
2. Analyze the changed files to understand what work is being done
3. Determine an appropriate descriptive branch name based on the changes
4. Create and switch to a new branch using `git checkout -b [new-branch-name]`
5. Verify the new branch was created and switched to with `git branch`
